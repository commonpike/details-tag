A polyfill for <details> tag.
Unfortunately, a seamless integration was unsuccessful.
To manipulate <details> tags from Javascript, use our API:

Know if a tag is open or no:
	$('details').details()

Open a tag
	$('details').details('open')

Close a tag
	$('details').details('close')

Event handlers:
	$('details').details('open', function(){
		console.log('Opened ', $(this));
	});
	$('details').details('close', function(){});

To make a tag animated
	<detail class=animated>

To control animation speeds
	<detail class=animated data-animation-speed="slow/fast/1000">

This will also manipulate native implemenations.
